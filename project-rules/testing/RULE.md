# Testing Rules

## Test Organization

<!-- Add rules for:

- Composable testing
- Utility function testing
- Mock patterns
-->

## Integration Testing

<!-- Add rules for:
- Testing component interactions
- Testing with real stores
- API mocking strategies
- Router testing
-->

## E2E Testing

<!-- Add rules for:
- E2E test organization
- Playwright/Cypress patterns
- Test data management
- Page object patterns
-->

## Test Coverage

<!-- Add rules for:

- What to test vs what to skip
- Critical path testing
- Edge case testing
-->

## Best Practices

# Folder Structure Rules

## Directory Organization

<!-- Add rules for:
- Root level folder structure
- src/ organization (components, views, composables, etc.)
- Asset organization (images, fonts, icons)
- Where to place utilities, helpers, constants
-->

## File Naming Conventions

<!-- Add rules for:
- Component file naming (PascalCase)
- Composable file naming (camelCase with 'use' prefix)
- Asset file naming (lowercase with dashes)
- Test file naming patterns
-->

## Component Organization

<!-- Add rules for:
- When to create a new component folder
- Co-locating component files (styles, tests, types)
- Shared vs feature-specific components
- Component index files
-->

## Module Boundaries

<!-- Add rules for:
- Feature folder structure
- Preventing circular dependencies
- Public vs internal APIs
- Barrel exports (index.ts files)
-->
